Massage the chicken to distribute the marinade then refrigerate the chicken for 8 to 12 hours, flipping it over a few times to distribute the marinade. 2. To cook the chicken, drain the chicken over a saucepan and set the pan over medium heat reduce the marinade it comes to a full boil, then reduce the heat and cook it longer, until it’s slightly boiled down. 3. Heat a grill pan or cast-iron skillet over high heat and add the chicken thighs, skin side down, cooking off only the amount of thighs in the pan so they are not crowded – I did three at a time in mine. 4. Sear the thighs for 2-3 minutes on each side, then cover, and cook for 6 minutes. 5. Remove the cover, wipe the condensation off the underside of the cover with a kitchen towel, flip the thighs over, cover, and cook for another 6 minutes. 6. Uncover the chicken and finish cooking them for about 3 minutes on each side, brushing and basting the chicken with the reserved marinade as you go, until the skin and meat have darkened. Remove from the pan and cook off the remaining chicken thighs the same way."

Cook until golden and crisp, then turn and cook the other side until golden as well. Add the wine and cook until it reduces by half. 3.Return the garlic and potatoes to the pan, along with the chicken stock, parsley, oregano, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Transfer to the oven and cook, uncovered, until the chicken is cooked through, about 45 minutes. Add the peas to the pan with 5 minutes left in the cooking time.

      "directions": "Combine the water, soy sauce, brown sugar and mirin in large ziploc bag and add the chicken thighs. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Let this sit in the fridge for at least an hour. To make the teriyaki sauce, just add the honey, soy sauce, mirin and sake to a small sauce pan and boil over medium heat until the sauce is glossy and slightly viscous (it won't get quite as thick as the jarred types). It should take on a caramelized taste but be careful not to burn it. When you're ready to grill the chicken, turn the broiler on and move the oven rack up to the upper position. Put a wire rack on a baking sheet (I use the rack out of my toaster oven), and put the chicken thighs skin side down onto the rack (the idea is to keep the meat elevated off the pan). Grill until brown then flip so the skin side faces up. Baste the skin side with teriyaki sauce and continue to broil until the skin is golden brown with just a few charred spots. Give the chicken one final baste with the teriyaki sauce and serve."

Rub the marinade off the meat, then season with a little more salt. Cook meat until charred on each side – about 5 mins on each side for rare; if the cut is very thick, you may want to roast it in a hot oven for 5 mins after searing. Lift onto a chopping board, then rest for 5 mins before carving into slices and serving with chips, if you like."

Make the filling by combining the meat, 1 egg, the onion, salt, black pepper, and paprika in the bowl of a food processor and pulse till it’s pureed. (You can also do this by passing the mixture through a meat grinder then stirring in the egg; if you want the onions to remain chunky, fold them into the mixture after the meat is puréed or ground.) Roll out the dough to less than 1/8th inch thick. Cut 3-inch squares as pictured above. Put a teaspoon of the meat in the center of each.  Mix the last egg with a little water and brush it on adjacent sides of each square, then enclose the filling in a triangular shape, sealing dry edge to egg-washed edge. Boil the dumplings in salted water till the pasta is cooked, 3 or 4 minutes.  Drain and chill beneath running water or in the cooking pot. When ready to cook, heat a large pan with enough oil to coat the bottom by about an eighth of an inch over medium high heat and sauté the dumplings till they’re golden brown and delicious as they are in the lead photo."
